# SnakeADA

This project is a simple Snake made with Ada, in a Bash console.
It was made during my first semester of studies in the French Institute of Technology of Grenoble, where I studied programming, and the first algorithmic courses were dispensed with Ada as a programming language.

**There are a few features used here that weren't allowed during our studies, so this project doesn't really reflect how Ada is taught there.**
